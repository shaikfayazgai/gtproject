## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

- Real-time notifications via WebSockets (v1 uses TanStack Query polling)
- In-app video recording for evidence submission (v1 supports video URL only)
- Advanced Skill Genome visualizations (radar charts, growth trajectory graphs)
- Multi-language content management (v1 designs for it, v2 implements CMS-backed i18n)
- Mobile-optimized component variants for Women's Portal (v1 is responsive web, v2 is mobile-first component redesign)
- Push notifications (PWA service worker)
- Advanced custom report builder with drag-and-drop
- Bulk user import/export for enterprise
- API webhook configuration for enterprise integrations
- SOW template library (v1 is upload-only, v2 adds curated templates)
- Tiptap rich text editor for evidence text submissions (v1 uses plain textarea)
- Evidence commenting / annotation (v1 is view + decision only)

---

## Out of Scope (v1)

| Exclusion | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Backend implementation | Handoff to separate developer — MSW mocks + @glimmora/types are the contract |
| Real authentication | Mock auth via Zustand store — Keycloak integration is backend scope |
| Real payment processing | UI only — actual payment gateway is backend scope |
| WhatsApp Business API integration | Design the UX flow, not the API — backend scope |
| Real-time features (WebSockets) | Simulated with TanStack Query polling — architecture supports upgrade |
| Mobile apps (React Native) | Responsive web only — mobile-first breakpoints, not native |
| Internationalization implementation | Design with RTL-awareness, language selector works — i18n strings are v2 |
| E2E testing (Playwright/Cypress) | Unit + component tests only — E2E post-backend-integration |
| Deployment pipeline (CI/CD) | Local dev environment only for this phase |
| Public profiles / leaderboards | **Architecture constraint, not scope decision — never build** |
| Contributor identity in review UI | **Architecture constraint — evidence viewer always hides contributor identity** |
