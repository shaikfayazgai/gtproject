# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Enterprise uploads SOW -> APG decomposes into tasks -> verified contributors deliver evidence -> enterprise reviews and releases payment -- all without manual recruitment or PM overhead.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 - Mentor Portal (plan 01 complete, 3 remaining)

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Tailwind v4 chosen over v3 (CSS-first @theme for simpler monorepo token sharing; validated empirically)
- [Roadmap]: MSW hybrid approach (types in @glimmora/types, handlers per-portal, shared factory functions extracted only if needed)
- [Roadmap]: DS-01 through DS-10 in Phase 1 (not Phase 2) to enable canary validation with real styled components
- [01-01]: tailwindcss added as @glimmora/config devDep for pnpm strict mode CSS resolution
- [01-01]: type:module added to all packages for clean ESM support under Node 25
- [01-01]: Port assignments: women=3001, university=3002, enterprise=3003, mentor=3004, admin=3005
- [01-02]: MSW build scripts approved via pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies in root package.json (pnpm v10 strict mode)
- [01-02]: Provider nesting: MSWProvider (outer) -> QueryProvider (inner) ensures mock intercepts before queries
- [01-02]: MSW workerDirectory configured as array of all 5 portal public dirs in root package.json
- [01-03]: Radix UI unified package exports namespaces -- use SlotPrimitive.Slot not bare Slot for asChild pattern
- [01-03]: Storybook 10 ESM-only config: no addon-essentials, only @storybook/addon-a11y
- [01-03]: Component pattern established: 'use client' per file, CVA variants, cn() utility, Radix primitives, forwardRef
- [01-04]: Home pages are Server Components -- @glimmora/ui components have 'use client' per-file so they compose safely
- [01-04]: Canary pages identical across all 5 portals -- proves toolchain uniformity, not portal differentiation
- [01-04]: Tailwind v4 + Storybook 10 + full toolchain VALIDATED -- pnpm turbo build zero errors, browser verified
- [02-04]: react-is override ^19.1.0 in root pnpm.overrides for recharts React 19 compatibility
- [02-04]: Custom SVG for simple shapes (ProgressRing/Sparkline/ActivityHeatmap), Recharts only for complex charts (BarChart)
- [02-04]: Data viz CSS variable pattern: all chart colors via var(--color-*), never hardcoded hex
- [02-01]: react-day-picker v9 classNames API for full Tailwind control (no separate CSS theming needed)
- [02-01]: cmdk v1.1.1 for Combobox -- no duplicate @radix-ui/react-dialog created
- [02-01]: Avatar anonymous mode uses deterministic SVG shapes from seed hash (6 shapes x 6 colors)
- [02-01]: Skeleton shimmer uses bg-hover (#F0E4DA warm earth) not grey
- [02-02]: AppShell uses React context (createContext + useAppShell hook) for sidebar state sharing between Sidebar/TopBar
- [02-02]: DataTable<T> generic type parameter with TanStack ColumnDef for type-safe columns
- [02-02]: KPIStatCard value is string|number to support formatted values like '92%' or '3.2d'
- [02-02]: Sidebar active indicator uses border-l-2 border-brand-primary (terracotta left accent)
- [02-03]: Evidence types have no contributor field -- blind review enforced at TypeScript interface level
- [02-03]: Skill Genome Panel sorted by tier then evidence count -- private progress only, no comparison/ranking
- [02-03]: Anonymized Team Card max 4 visible skills with +N overflow
- [02-03]: APG Feed uses inline expandable details rather than nested Accordion
- [03-01]: Cookie-based locale (NEXT_LOCALE) for next-intl instead of URL-prefix routing
- [03-01]: MSW handlers migrated from flat file to handlers/ directory (auth, onboarding, canary)
- [03-01]: lucide-react added as direct dependency to women-portal for Shield/CheckCircle icons
- [03-01]: Pre-auth route group pattern: app/(pre-auth)/ for all unauthenticated pages
- [03-02]: APGActivity type mapping: hyphens in types -> underscores for APGFeed component via TYPE_MAP
- [03-02]: Evidence rework pack pre-seeded in MSW handlers for task-005 so rework view has data
- [03-02]: Common MSW factory helper (randomId, isoNow) in factories/common.ts for reuse
- [03-02]: Pipeline visualization in submission tracker uses simple div bars (not TimelineBar component)
- [03-04]: Task discovery uses Available/My Tasks/Completed tabs (students choose tasks, not assigned)
- [03-04]: PDF export uses dynamic import (await import('@react-pdf/renderer')) to avoid SSR crashes
- [03-04]: University Portal auth store uses zustand persist with localStorage for session continuity
- [03-04]: lucide-react added as direct dependency to university-portal for sidebar icons
- [03-03]: SkillNode level mapped to SkillGenomePanel tier enum (beginner->emerging, intermediate->developing, advanced->proficient, expert->expert)
- [03-03]: Messages use senderRole display ('You'/'Support Lead') not names -- privacy-preserving async messaging
- [03-03]: Privacy defaults set to maximum restriction (profileVisibleToTeam=false, earningsVisible=false)
- [03-03]: Settings root page uses sidebar navigation linking to sub-routes (/privacy, /notifications, /devices)
- [03-03]: Notification prefs grid uses actual @glimmora/types channels (in_app/email) and categories (task_updates/payments/messages/platform)
- [03-05]: Governor views use type-level privacy enforcement -- GovernorMetrics/CohortTrend structurally cannot contain individual identifiers
- [03-05]: Governor sub-navigation uses Link + usePathname active state pattern (same-layout tabs)
- [03-05]: TaskCategory uses isEnabled (actual type field) not isActive; factory data adapted to match actual types throughout
- [03-gap]: @glimmora/ui Label is a <p> element NOT a <label> -- does NOT accept htmlFor; use native <label> HTML element for form associations
- [03-gap]: GradientCard gap: all 3 KPI cards must use GradientCard (not KPIStatCard); 3rd card uses inline style gradient
- [03-gap]: PoDLPDFDocument must NOT be barrel-exported; use await import('./podl-pdf-document') inside event handlers only
- [04-01]: MentorProfile renamed to MentorOnboardingProfile in mentor.ts (avoids conflict with MentorProfile from user.ts which extends User)
- [04-01]: react-resizable-panels v4 uses plain functions (not forwardRef) -- Group/Panel/Separator use elementRef prop
- [04-01]: Mentor auth store has 3 roles: applicant, pending_onboarding, mentor (zustand persist)
- [04-01]: Application status polling via TanStack Query refetchInterval: 5000 (stops on approved/rejected)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4: 3-panel resizable layout ready (react-resizable-panels v4 wrapper installed and exported)
- Phase 5: SOW Blueprint Editor (4-panel synchronized scroll) has no library equivalent -- needs spike
- Pre-existing: `pnpm turbo build` now passes cleanly across all 5 portals (was previously failing with webpack-runtime TypeError)
- [03-01]: next-intl INSTALLED in both portals (resolved from planning blocker)
- [03-04]: @react-pdf/renderer INSTALLED in university-portal (resolved from blocker)
